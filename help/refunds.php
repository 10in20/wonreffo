							<p><b>We are happy only if you're happy.</b>  If you aren't 100% satisfied with your purchase, let us know. You have 60 days after we ship you your order to explore the benefits of the product and draw your own conclusions. Hopefully, you'll become one of the many customers who contact us to share the joy of their experience with us.</p>
							<p>Keep in mind that we are usually advising all our customers to take some time with the supplements in order for them to prove their effect over the organism, before reaching a conclusion.</p>
							<p>Yet, if you are not satisfied with your investment, you can easily ask for your money back! It's our duty to make sure you are contented with your decision and to stand by you any moment of our journey together, wherever it may lead.</p>

We'll make sure you'll know the date, as we'll send you an email to announce you the shipment, and you can also check it on the delivered package.</p>

							<img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" width="200" src="../statics/img/return-of-investment.png" alt="">

							<p class="py-3 py-md-5 text-center">To get a refund, you must send the supplement bottles back to us, to the following address: 19655 E 35th Dr #100, Aurora, CO 80011, USA.. Please keep in mind that we do not support the return shipping costs. It's ok if you sent them even on the 59th day of your 60-day money back guarantee period and we receive them several days later. You will still get a refund if you shipped in due time.</p>
